# TRACEvar
TRACEvar is a pathogenic variant prioritization tool, based on tissue-specific ML models
In the Code folder you can find the folowing py files:
1. Find_Best_ML_Paraneters.py - This file taking TRACEvar dataset and finding the best-parameter (BP) for tuning eight ML methods for tissue-specific variant prioritizing.
2. Compare_ML_Methods.py - Based on TRACEvar dataset and the BP from 1, this script 
3. Create_TRACEvar_Models.py - This file taking TRACEvar dataset and creating 17 tissue-specific RF models.
4.
